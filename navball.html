            The sphere you see above is supposed to resemble a <i>navball</i>.
            The navball is central to piloting a space craft in the game <i>Kerbal Space Program</i>,
            though my navball is designed to resemble the <i>Flight Director Attitude Indicator (FDAI)</i>
            of the Apollo Command Module.

            Generally when one wants to make a 3D object they would design a mesh, the geometry of the object.
            They would then create a texture, the colours and design of the object.
            Then they would hand these things to the graphics card of the computer to show on the screen.
            <br><br>
            But special thing about the example that you see above is that it exists entirely within a fragment shader.
            What that means is the computer gives the graphics card nothing more than the square canvas that the object
            should be rendered to.
            The graphics card will then run a small program on every single pixel in the canvas and return a colour that
            should be drawn on the canvas.
